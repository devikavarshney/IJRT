### ⭐ Introduction

The proposed system applies to all Police stations across the country and specifically looks into the subject of Crime Records Management. It is well understood that Crime Prevention, Detection and Conviction of criminals depend on a highly responsive backbone of Information Management. The efficiency of the police function and the effectiveness with which it tackles crime depend on what quality of information it can derive from its existing records and how fast it can have access it.
It is proposed to centralize Information Management in Crime for the purpose of fast and efficient sharing of critical information across all police stations in the country. Not just restricting to police stations.

This web app can be accessed by the Commissioner of Police Service and the Court of Law. While the former can use it to view the active officers at a particular station or add some officers to the list, the latter can announce final verdict for minor cases based on the facts and evidences submitted by the office without any physical appearance, thus helping speedy and successful completion to cases.
The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture for the three backbones of Indian Judiciary- Chief Commissioner of Police Service, Police Officers and the Court of Law, with centralized storage of the database.

### ⭐ Abstract

We see that when a group or society is formed, some rules and laws are absolutely necessary. These are made by the people and for the people. The purpose of these rules and laws is to provide a peaceful life to all those who are living in that society. In modern days, crime is increasing manifold times. 

To combat such crimes and to provide safety to citizens, the police department plays a vital role. It is always a vital responsibility to arrest criminals who are a threat for the safety of society. After FIR is registered by a citizen, police start investigation and after collecting all the proof against the criminal, it is his duty to present all the proofs honestly to the court so that the right man can get the right punishment. 

With a whooping population of 137cr, which is second-highest in the world, India is considered to have one of the largest Judiciary in the world. Its independence from the Executive and legislature makes it the most powerful
But the only drawback which Indian Judiciary is currently suffering is its efficiency. According to stats and figures, it takes 2184 days (nearly 6 years) for a judicial case to be solved, thus increasing total case-load to 4.4 cr. Thus, there is an urgent requirement for an automated system to help the Judiciary in the Internet-driven era, which could not only assist police officers in obtaining background details of those found guilty but also help the courts in controlling total case-load and delivering final verdicts to minor cases in no time. 
With this motivation to automate Judicial activities, we propose Judiciary Database System working at 3 levels.

At first, the Chief commissioner can use it to get all officers working at a station and their designation. Next, the police officers who can add criminals to list, view already existing criminal list, request a court of law for judgement based on supporting details. Finally, the Courts themselves, who can review pending cases and even announce minor cases in no time. This upgradation might prove to be a turning stone in Indian History.


### ⭐ Objectives

-	To keep record of criminal’s details for future investigation.
-	To obtain relevant information regarding police officers and criminals all at one place.
-	To help courts deliver speedy justice to all.
-	To reduce manual and redundant record keeping.
-	To facilitate interaction and sharing of information among police departments, districts, state/headquarters and other police agencies.
-	Building security and monitoring control so as to ensure only authorized personnel have access to the criminal information.
