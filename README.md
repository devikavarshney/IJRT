### ‚≠ê Introduction
The proposed system applies to all Police stations across the country and specifically looks into the subject of Crime Records Management. It is well understood that Crime Prevention, Detection and Conviction of criminals depend on a highly responsive backbone of Information Management. The efficiency of the police function and the effectiveness with which it tackles crime depend on what quality of information it can derive from its existing records and how fast it can have access it.
It is proposed to centralize Information Management in Crime for the purpose of fast and efficient sharing of critical information across all police stations in the country. Not just restricting to police stations.

This web app can be accessed by the Commissioner of Police Service and the Court of Law. While the former can use it to view the active officers at a particular station or add some officers to the list, the latter can announce final verdict for minor cases based on the facts and evidences submitted by the office without any physical appearance, thus helping speedy and successful completion to cases.
The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture for the three backbones of Indian Judiciary- Chief Commissioner of Police Service, Police Officers and the Court of Law, with centralized storage of the database.
